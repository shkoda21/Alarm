# Alarm
Alarm clock using Python

In this Python project, I used  Python libraries, such as, Tkinter, playsound and datetime. I provided a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format and selection a sound.

Defined a function named as alarm() which takes the argument of (set_time). First, it checks than input is correct. Than, It contains a while loop with a Boolean function True which makes the program automatic to work.

Defined another function here named alarm_time() which takes in the user value for setting the alarm in the string format. The same argument of (set_time) as alarm before to execute the while loop which I use while making GUI.

If loop suggests that if the user input time set_time matches with the while loop ongoing time now, the message is showed as ” Wake up” and selected sound is playing.
